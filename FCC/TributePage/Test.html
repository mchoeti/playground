                <h3> About Dogs</h3>
                <p>Dogs are domesticated animals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have              been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.
                    Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet                 because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans.</p>

                <p>Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs often chase cats, and most dogs will                 fetch a ball or stick.</p>

                <p>Dogs can smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well in color because they are color blind. Due               to the anatomy of the eye, dogs can see better in dim light than humans. They also have a wider field of              vision. </p>

              <p>Dogs are often called "man's best friend" because they fit in with human life. Dogs can serve people in many           ways. For example, there are guard dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, guide dogs for blind people, and police            dogs</p>

              <p>There are at least 800 breeds of dogs. Dogs whose parents were the same breed are called purebred or pure              pedigree dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called mutts or          mixed-breed dogs</p>
